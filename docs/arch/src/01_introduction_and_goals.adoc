== Introduction and Goals
The reflow controller by Beta layout controlls a convection oven to solder a PCB board with SMT part on it. Unfortunately the controller 
has only a command line interface via serial port.

The following image shows a typical reflow diagram with its five phases:

* Preheat
* Soak
* Reflow
* Dwell
* Cooling

The ReflowController application offers the possebility to configure and to visualize such a reflow process via a graphical user interface.
